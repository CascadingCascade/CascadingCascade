### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my profile!
No, I am not going to tell you what my real name is or how to contact me, at least not yet (If you really have something to say, maybe you can use [this](https://github.com/CascadingCascade/CascadingCascade/issues)?). Especially since 🏳️‍⚧️. Can't risk my transphobe parents finding out their son actually really, really wants to be a girl, can we? 😉 China is also not exactly the best place to live for LGBTQ+ people. 😞 But hey, since here on GitHub, nobody knows who I am anyway, (And almost nobody's going read this, too) I am going to just stop this self-denial and say this: (If you are confused why all this text, check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil) out, I've added some parentheses for readability)

I declare that, (persuant to (the fact that my gender-nonconforming desires are firm, continuous and long lasting, being extant since a quite early age) and (the promotive influence from a friend of mine)), (as an assertion of an abstract, subjective allegation, with emphasis on the personal meaning / importance of its implications), (that contra my previous identification as a cisgender male with rather unorthodox imaginations, which is currently considered to be a product of denial and fear of the implications of my actual identity), I identify as, (with modest reservations due to inherent uncertainty of validation from subjective perceptions and openness to revision in light of potential future discoveries), transgender. 😌 😆 😘 🏳️‍⚧️

Have been coding since like, middle school? I actually don't remember, it's been so long. I started coding in Java back when the main JDK version was 13 or 14, IIRC, and now it's on its way to breach 20 :joy: (Edit: I checked some of my old programming books, judging by their printing date, I apparently started coding at some point in 2016, wow.)

Currently a CS student, Reasonably proficient with C/Java/Kotlin, learning Verilog/C++/Ada/Haskell. You can find me at [this repository](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C), probably. (On the other hand, you probably found me there in the first place, then decided to pay my profile a visit)

Note: A new semester have started here in China, my availability may be limited except on weekends.
