This is the rant I previously placed on my profile, I deemed it too long and deranged for unsuspecting visitors:

I declare that, (persuant to (the fact that my gender-nonconforming desires are firm, continuous and long lasting, being extant since a quite early age) and (the promotive influence from a friend of mine)), (as an assertion of an abstract, subjective allegation, with emphasis on the personal meaning / importance of its implications), (that contra my previous identification as a cisgender male with rather unorthodox imaginations, which is currently considered to be a product of denial and fear of the implications of my actual identity), I identify as, (with modest reservations due to inherent uncertainty of validation from subjective perceptions and openness to revision in light of potential future discoveries), transgender. üòå üòÜ üòò üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

And since you are here anyway, let me say a few more words, okay? 
Being transgender really sucks. I have constantly questioned my own identity since an early age, which really stressed myself out. 
And even after it has become undeniable that I am not only just a cisgender male with hyperactive imagination, I continue struggle with self-doubt anyway. 
"Am I just faking it?" I am sure every trans individual on this planet of ours asked themselves this question. 
But the dysphoria is real and it hurts. I currently have a bipolar diagnosis and have attempted suicide multiple times in the past. 
When acute gender dysphoria strikes, it feels simply unbearable, "despair" alone does not do it justice. 
I would say feels like crushing inferiority: "I will never get to be a bona fide girl... I will ever only be male wearing dresses and imagining himself a woman..." 
and overwhelming helplessness: "I am done for... My life is done for..." 
coupled with a crippling complusion to just commit suicide or at least some self-harm. 
(You wouldn't believe how many self-harm scars I got, I probably won't be able to wear short sleeved clothes for the rest of life) 
It doesn't help that I also, by a staggering coincidence, also (professionally diagnosed as) autistic. (Bad things does happen in pairs, does they not?) 
For example, I simply can't talk to strangers in real life and it's hard even when talking to what little friends I do have, 
my mouth simply seize up and refuse to move, whatever words that do came out are scrambled and stammering. 
I feel a lot of weird and repetitive compulsions every day, as well as various usual sensations. 
I also often accidently insult people IRL because I can't think about every word for hours like I am doing right now in a real time conversation. 
Well, there are some perks too though, such an excellent memory 
(I would say _too_ excellent, there are countless things I would rather forget, but they cling to my mind relentlessly). 
Or an almost uncanny ability to run my brain in some alternate mode when doing certain math and logic related things (Like programming!) that causes strong headache 
but also grants superhuman working memory and greatly boosted reasoning abilities. 
Despite it all, I must say that on good days, there's a strange sense of wonder and pride, an appreciation of my own unique existence. I guess I understand why the LGBT and autism community would use the word "pride" so much, hmm... 
It feels like my life actually have meaning, that I have been placed into my predicament as a part of a grand plan or something, 
an euphoria I can't quite put my finger on. 
Anyway, thanks for reading. It feels good to vent sometimes, even if there's probably nobody listening, yes?
